## Chapter 1. Introduction


<blockquote>
<h1>What is concurrency?</h1>
<blockquote>
- Concurrency in Java is the ability to run multiple tasks or threads simultaneously. It allows you to take advantage
of multi-core processors to improve the performance of your applications.
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, CPUs and Operating Systems were only able
to operate a single process over time. This proved to be
time consuming and quite annoying to end users. Programs had</p>
to run synchronous and could not operate asynchronous.


<p>Concurrency, allows programs to take advantage of CPUs</p>
by running multithreaded and asynchronous.

<blockquote>
<h1>Threads?</h1>
<blockquote>
- Threads "often called lightweight processors" are treated as a basic unit of scheduling.

Threads execute asynchronously and simultaneously with respect to one another.
</blockquote>

<h3>Benefits of Threads</h3>
- Reduce development and maintenance costs
- Turn convoluted code into straight-line maintainable code
- Improve responsiveness of GUI applications
- Simplify the implementation of the JVM

<h3>Risks of threads</h3>
-
