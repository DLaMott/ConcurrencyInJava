<h1>What is concurrency?</h1>
<blockquote>

of multi-core processors to improve the performance of your applications.

<p>In the past, CPUs and Operating Systems were only able
to operate a single process over time. This proved to be
time consuming and quite annoying to end users. Programs had</p>
to run synchronous and could not operate asynchronous.


<p>Concurrency, allows programs to take advantage of CPUs</p>
by running multithreaded and asynchronous.
